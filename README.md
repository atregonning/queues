#queues

An exercise with Java queue data structures. 

Deque is a linked list implementation of a double-ended queue for generic items. All operations run in constant worst-case time, and the list uses 48N + 40 bytes.

RandomizedQueue is a resizing array implementation of a generic queue, with a dequeue() method that randomly (uniformly) selects an item for removal. All operations are supported in constant amortized time, with memory usage of around 32N + 24 bytes.
